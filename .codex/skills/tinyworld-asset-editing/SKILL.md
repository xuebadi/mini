# Tiny World Asset Editing

Use the existing board intent contract:

- `world[x][z]` is intent and `cellMeshes['x,z']` is render state.
- New asset edits must flow through `setCell(x, z, opts)` or helpers that call it.
- Selection state is exposed through `window.__tinyworldSelection`; use `worldCoords()`, `materialize()`, and `replaceWorldCoords()`. Do not parse raw `selectedCells` keys in new code.

Placement rules:

- Bulk placement over a selection should call the normal `applyTool()` path once per selected world coord with `{ skipSelectionBulk: true }`. This preserves tool variants, terrain overrides, ghost transforms, fence logic, model stamp settings, and existing `setCell` side effects.
- Freehand drawing uses `dragMode === 'draw'`, `drawVisitedCells`, `drawLastWorldCoord`, and `applyDrawToolToHit()`. Drawing should not repeatedly stack terrain, bridges, or same-kind objects while the pointer crosses the same cell.
- Fence, wall, and boundary are still `kind: 'fence'`; use `fenceSide` plus `floors`. Wall starts at level 4, boundary at level 5. Drawing a higher-level fence over an existing same-side fence should upgrade to that base level, not silently no-op. This also applies when the fence is stored as an `extras` entry beside another occupant.

Clipboard and templates:

- The asset clipboard shape is `{ version, origin, size, cells: [{ dx, dz, cell }] }`.
- Build clipboard cells with `cloneCellIntent()` so terrain, terrain height, kind, floors, building type, fence side, extras, rotation, `offsetX/Y/Z`, appearance, and `waterFlow` survive copy/paste and saved templates.
- Template saves live under `tinyworld:asset-templates.v1` in `localStorage`. Keep these world-intent templates separate from model stamps and voxel build stamps.
- Pasting or duplicating a multi-cell clipboard should call `replaceWorldCoords()` with placed cells so the pasted region stays selected for immediate follow-up edits.
- Paste actions should target the hovered cell first, then fall back to the selected region origin. Clear stale hover when the pointer leaves the canvas so this fallback remains reachable. The latest-template shortcut should paste the loaded template, not just stage it in memory.

Selection properties:

- Keep selection property controls grouped by durable sections (`Edit`, `Transform`, `Appearance`, `Ground`) so dense multi-selection actions stay scannable.
- Section changes should be presentation-only unless the edit contract changes; preserve existing row keys and route behavior through `applySelectionProperty()`.
- Use `currentValue` plus `aria-pressed`/`.active` on property chips when a selected value is uniform, and leave mixed selections unpressed.

Stamps panel:

- Stamps navigation is client-side. `stampBuilderAllTools()` builds model, voxel, and built-in stamp tools; filtering combines active category and search text.
- Include terrain/landscape tools in Stamps alongside objects so the panel can replace toolbar hunting for grass/path/dirt/water/stone/lava/sand/snow placement.
- Category counts should reflect the current search. Search is token-based: every whitespace-separated term must match the tool search text. Status text should reflect the number of shown stamps and the active category/search.
- Model-stamp categories are inferred from labels, paths, formats, URLs, and sidecars. Do not add generator manifest fields unless a durable category contract is explicitly needed.

Validation:

- Run the inline script syntax check, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
- Browser-check Stamps category plus search, selected bulk placement, draw wall/boundary behavior, copy/paste/templates, duplicate, `1`/`E`, `R`/`F`, clear, perspective toggle, and console errors.
