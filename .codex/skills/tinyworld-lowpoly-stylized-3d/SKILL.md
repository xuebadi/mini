# Tiny World Low-Poly Stylized 3D

Use this together with:

- Project skill `.codex/skills/tinyworld-single-file/SKILL.md` for single-file constraints.
- Project skill `.codex/skills/tinyworld-render-performance/SKILL.md` for GPU/shadow/renderer limits.
- Installed skill `.agents/skills/3d-modeling/SKILL.md` for topology, UV, export, LOD, and GLB hygiene.
- Installed skill `.agents/skills/poly-pizza-api/SKILL.md` when sourcing low-poly models from Poly Pizza.
- Installed skill `.agents/skills/lightweight-3d-effects/SKILL.md` when adding decorative lightweight 3D effects.

## Tiny World art direction

- Low-poly, toy-like, readable at thumbnail size.
- Chunky primitives with bevels/rounded slabs, not realistic detail.
- Strong silhouettes beat micro-detail.
- Bright but not washed out: use saturated local color plus darker trim/shadow-side material.
- Keep texture use rare and intentional. Procedural `THREE.MeshLambertMaterial` colors should remain the default for built-in objects.
- Custom/generated voxel stamps should not render full bounding-cage trim by default; reserve bounds frames for explicit decorative-outline stamps.
- If generated voxel stamps include a broad ground/platform part, sink that base into the terrain rather than showing a raised tile under the object.
- Use flat/Lambert lighting semantics compatible with Three.js r128.
- Avoid glossy/PBR realism unless an imported asset already depends on it.

## Scale rules

- One grid tile is `1 x 1` world unit.
- Small props should fit comfortably inside a tile: ~0.2–0.8 units wide.
- Houses can occupy one or multiple tiles, but doors/windows must remain readable from the default camera.
- Flying ambient objects should be scaled to feel like toys above the board, not real-world aircraft; crop duster wingspan target is around 1–1.5 tiles.
- Always normalize imported model scale with `Box3` bounds, then apply a target span.
- Apply orientation fixes once at model root or a named wrapper; do not keep stacking ad-hoc rotations in the animation loop.

## Material and palette rules

- Prefer 2–4 materials per object: body, dark trim, highlight, accent.
- Bespoke generated voxel/custom-part models should use semantic material
  families rather than collapsing to the seed material. A greenhouse needs
  glass + frame + planting/base materials; an airship needs hull + brass/copper
  machinery + fabric/canvas balloon panels + cable/rope rigging + glass
  bridge/window accents.
- Use the custom-part `cable` primitive for actual connections: balloon ropes,
  crane lines, tethers, rigging, moorings, bridge suspension lines, and other
  angled cords. Do not fake these as vertical stone/wood columns when endpoints
  are known.
- Use custom-part `sphere`/`ellipsoid` primitives for rounded balloon
  envelopes, domes, tanks, and soft canopies. Panel bands or ribs can be boxes
  only when they read as raised seams; colored balloon fabric panels should use
  curved ellipsoid slices (`phiStart`/`phiLength`) rather than square side
  plates.
- Default custom-part stamps should be board-scale on first creation. Compact
  bridges, decks, docks, and props should be about one tile wide and can use a
  small negative Y offset to sit into the terrain/water; only deliberate hero
  objects should claim 1.5+ tiles.
- Native TinyWorld objects can be used as parts of a scene, but they should not
  stand in for a requested model when `customParts` can express the model
  directly.
- Never mutate shared `M.*` material colors for one instance; clone or create a new material. The one allowed global exception is `applySeasonFoliage()`, which centrally retints shared foliage/grass materials for season changes.
- Three.js r128 `MeshLambertMaterial` does not accept `flatShading`; keep faceted model-stamp fallbacks through non-indexed/flat-normal geometry instead of unsupported material flags.
- Cottage-style defaults are now part of the built-in material language: use deterministic canvas textures (`texCottageGrass`, `texCottageWood`, `texCottageGlass`, `texCottageStone`, `texCottageDirt`) for grass, board-side/foundation stone, windows, wood, and dirt before adding new ad-hoc texture generators.
- For imported texture variants, create explicit material variants and swap them at the model mesh level.
- For toolbar thumbnails, increase contrast/saturation carefully so icons read against the white toolbar, but keep the in-world material natural.
- If a model comes with a texture atlas, set `texture.encoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding` and check `flipY` for GLTF compatibility.
- Repo-backed model stamps must run a material hydration pass: preserve real embedded materials, apply known sidecar atlases (GLTF atlases use `flipY = false`), parse OBJ `.mtl` sidecars when present, warn when they are missing, and apply a deterministic TinyWorld palette fallback to blank `palette`/white materials so imports do not look like unpainted 3D prints.
- Model stamp factories should apply `opts.appearance` themselves so world rendering, ghost previews, and selection previews share texture/color overrides; avoid applying the same model-stamp appearance again at the board render wrapper.
- Wear-and-tear should stay stylized: global grime/desaturation plus small batched chips/scuffs/moss beats realistic noise-heavy shader work.
- Floating-board depth can reuse existing roof language by inverting a stepped roof form under the board: dark gray shingle-textured slabs, board-footprint width/depth, vertically compressed, and attached below the dirt body. Utility underside dressing should stay toy-like and readable: chunky pipe cylinders, cable trays, clamps, junction boxes, and short dangling cable drops in the existing steel/dark underside palette.
- Visual richness should come from selective density contrast: keep cliffs,
  walls, terrain bodies, and island masses chunky, then spend extra detail on
  roofs, windows, crops, trees, path storytelling, and hero landmarks. Prefer
  instanced/rule-based surface detail such as wheel ruts, edge roots, tiny
  signs/crates, and beacon/banners over globally raising voxel resolution.
- The Tower house variant has paired factories: `makeStoneTower` is the normal faceted/conical design and `makeVoxelStoneTower` is the voxel counterpart. Keep their silhouettes aligned when changing tower roof, balcony, window, door, or flag details. Castle/turret rendering should stay block-built: `makeTurret` delegates to the square voxel keep in `makeVoxelTurret`.

## Model import hygiene

- Keep assets under `models/` and ensure `publish.sh` copies them to `dist/models/`.
- Use `THREE.GLTFLoader` from the Three.js r128 examples CDN if loading GLB/GLTF in the single HTML file.
- After loading:
  1. compute `Box3`, center model at origin,
  2. scale to target tile/world size,
  3. set cast/receive shadow intentionally,
  4. tag moving subparts in `userData`,
  5. dispose cloned materials/geometries if removed.
- Search named nodes before doing geometry surgery. Common names: `prop`, `propeller`, `blade`, `rotor`, `fan`, `wheel`, `flap`.

## Animation rules

- Animate only transforms and opacity.
- Respect the existing `userData.landing` pattern for placed cell objects.
- For propellers: wrap or find the named prop mesh, spin around its local blade axis every frame, and add a translucent disc for high-RPM readability. For TinyWorld-built lift engines, keep the fan plane centred on the lower shaft mount, prefer a shared dark shader blur/strobe disc, and hide physical blade groups once the spin ramp reaches speed.
- For rocket/jet flames: prefer chunky pixel/block shader sheets or capped
  particle pools over many animated micro-meshes. Preserve the toy-like
  silhouette with a plume that narrows toward the bottom, hard flicker bands,
  and warm core/outer colours rather than realistic volumetric fire. When
  replacing an object style, keep the older object factory as an inactive
  legacy helper instead of deleting it.
- For aircraft: use shallow easing, pitch with climb/descent slope, and bank during turns. Do not teleport or dive straight down into the board.
- Small world motion is preferred over heavy renderer tricks: tree asymmetry,
  crop/wheat/corn/sunflower sway, window glow, smoke, waterfalls, clouds, and
  engine movement should sell life while keeping object roots in the existing
  `animatedCellObjects`/runtime sets.
- Particle effects should be capped and use cheap cloned `MeshBasicMaterial`; dispose particle materials when particles die.

## Validation checklist

- Inline script passes: `perl -0ne 'print $1 if m#<script>\s*(.*?)\s*</script>#s' tiny-world-builder.html | node --check`.
- `./publish.sh` copies any new assets into `dist/`.
- Default camera shows the asset at the intended scale.
- Shadows are visible but not noisy; no huge new shadow casters.
- Toolbar thumbnail remains readable.
- No material mutation leaks into other objects.
