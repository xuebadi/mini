# Tiny World Mode Safety

## Mode safety

- Boot always ends on the Select tool: `bootApp` calls
  `selectTool(DEFAULT_TOOL)` *after* `loadState()`, so a restored world's saved
  `toolId` never leaves a fresh session "armed" for building.
- Build/Play mode is separate from Showcase. `#build-play-mode` toggles
  `body.tw-play-mode`, persists `tinyworld:build-play-mode.v1`, and exposes
  `window.__tinyworldIsPlayMode()` / `window.__tinyworldMode`. In PLAY mode,
  build panels and edit radials are hidden, selection/sub-edit state is cleared,
  and mutation paths should be gated through the same edit checks that call
  `mpEditAllowed()`.
- First load uses the same Build/Play contract through `#welcome-modal`: the
  rounded `.launch-modal` shows `assets/twlogo.png` with BUILD and PLAY buttons,
  includes the compact "Created by Jason Kneen" footer with `@jasonkneen` and
  `@tinyworldsapp` links, hides app chrome via `body.welcome-launch-open`, and calls
  `window.__tinyworldMode` when the user chooses. Do not bring back the old
  farm/vehicle welcome picker for this path, and keep `publish.sh` copying the
  `assets/` directory into `dist/assets/`.
- Showcase mode keeps only a simple top-right circular `#showcase-exit` X
  button visible. Do not turn it back into a wide "Exit Showcase Esc" text pill;
  keep `aria-keyshortcuts="Escape"` and the existing Escape handler that calls
  `setShowcaseActive(false)`.
- `#mode-indicator` (HUD chip, updated in `updateModeIndicator` in
  `19-tools-toolbar.js`) names the current mode and colours itself: calm
  `mode-select`, amber `mode-build`, red `mode-erase`. Keep it
  `pointer-events:none`.
- `Esc` disarms any build/paint/erase tool back to Select (handler in
  `20-input-place-erase.js`, skipped in first-person walk mode).

## Gotcha

`npm test` (`tools/check.js` / `smoke-static.js`) reconstructs the split app
from `tiny-world-builder.html` plus `engine/**/*.js`. Update those static guards
when changing boot mode, launcher chrome, or mode persistence.


## Bottom toolbar vs floating block palette

- The grouped bottom `.toolbar` is the default. The **"Show groups"** checkbox in
  Settings → App (`#toolbar-show-groups`, persisted as `tinyworld:showGroups`,
  default on) switches modes. When off, `body.hide-groups` hides `.toolbar` and a
  floating, resizable, draggable `#tool-palette` shows **every** placeable block
  (select + all `TOOL_GROUPS` tools with house variants expanded + erase).
- The palette is a self-contained module: `engine/world/35-tool-palette.js`.
  Blocks are built with `buildToolButton(t, { flyout: true })`, so they keep
  their colors and are highlighted by the same `updateToolActiveStates()` loop.
- **Small screens force grouped mode.** `showGroupsEnabled()` returns true on
  `<=700px` regardless of the stored pref (`isSmallScreenForGroups()`), the
  checkbox is disabled there, and a `resize` listener re-applies across the
  breakpoint. The floating palette is unusable on phones, so never let it open
  there. The phone toolbar is also compacted to icon-only (labels/chevrons
  hidden, smaller buttons) in the `@media (max-width: 700px)` block.
  The grid uses fixed 64px square cells (`repeat(auto-fill, 64px)`), so resizing
  the panel reflows blocks to the nearest square. `buildToolbar()` calls
  `rebuildToolPaletteIfActive()` so toolbar rebuilds refresh an open palette.
- The group **popout** flyout (`.flyout.tool-menu`) lays its icons out as a
  2-row grid block (`gridTemplateColumns: repeat(ceil(n/2), auto)` set in
  `renderToolGroupFlyout`).
- The old `#mode-indicator` HUD chip has been **removed** from the DOM;
  `updateModeIndicator()` still runs but no-ops on the missing element.
