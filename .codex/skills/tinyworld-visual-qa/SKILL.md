# Tiny World Visual QA

Use the browser route `http://localhost:3000/tiny-world-builder` when available.

Checks:

- Console has no app errors.
- Toolbar shortcuts still work: `0`, `1`-`9`, letter tools, `E`.
- Left-click places only on the editable home board.
- Right-drag and Space+drag pan smoothly.
- Dragging/clicking the minimap canvas pans the camera target while dragging the minimap chrome/footer still moves the widget.
- Minimap colours should track live scene materials plus time/weather theme tint, not a stale fixed palette.
- Orbit still works with normal left-drag.
- Ghost boards do not become editable.
- The opacity torch is smooth and does not reveal square board seams.
- Tilt-shift overlays have `pointer-events: none`, stay below UI controls, and remain visible during pan/orbit/zoom movement.
- Cloud shadow at 0% / low values should reduce ground shadow strength without hiding visible cloud puffs.
- Building details should be believable: manor portico columns stay entry-scale, windows have frames/crossbars, and tall buildings do not stretch entry features unrealistically.
- Toolbar flyouts should sit clear of the toolbar (about 10px), avoid vertical clipping, and reduce empty thumbnail air via camera/frustum framing rather than negative CSS margins inside scrollable flyout containers.
- The Stamps panel should open as a compact floating canvas panel, stay open while placing items, drag by its header, avoid AI/create/enhance controls, and keep darker thumbnail previews readable.
- Dialog titles should use the shared Fraunces `.modal-head strong` treatment, with explanatory body copy in `.modal-copy` / `.confirm-copy` and readable darker muted text.
- Selection preview in the floating agent panel should show useful property chips for the primary selected kind. Supported properties (e.g. tower Top/Body colour, building Shape, Size) should apply immediately through `setCell`; unsupported creative edits can fall back to prompts.
- Selection preview must render the same object/stamp factory as the world view. Voxel-build/custom objects should not fall back to a generic blue cube.
- Selection preview markup and wiring must stay connected: `selection-preview-canvas`, `selection-preview-actions`, and the Preview/Details tabs should exist in the panel, and `renderSelection()` should call `updateSelectionPreview()` as the selected target changes.
- Selection colour controls should offer a broad palette for supported object parts, not just 3-4 legacy swatches.
- Planet-underlay visual proof should use deterministic proof URLs such as `http://localhost:3000/tiny-world-builder?planet=desert&planetStyle=lowpoly&planetDrop=60&seed=skytest&planetProof=1` and `http://localhost:3000/tiny-world-builder?planet=desert&planetStyle=realistic&planetDrop=60&seed=skytest&planetProof=1`: they hide non-canvas chrome, dismiss the welcome modal, widen the perspective camera, apply the underlay horizon haze and between-layer atmosphere sheets, and leave a small proof badge. Prefer this over judging one-shot screenshots where normal UI panels or default camera framing obscure the underlay.

Useful browser probes:

```js
pickTile(window.innerWidth / 2, window.innerHeight / 2)
```

```js
getComputedStyle(document.body, '::before').pointerEvents
getComputedStyle(document.body, '::after').pointerEvents
```
