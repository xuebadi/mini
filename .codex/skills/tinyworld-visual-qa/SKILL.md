# Tiny World Visual QA

Use the browser route `http://localhost:3000/tiny-world-builder` when available.

Checks:

- Console has no app errors.
- Toolbar shortcuts still work: `0`, `1`-`9`, letter tools, `E`.
- Left-click places only on the editable home board.
- Right-drag and Space+drag pan smoothly.
- Dragging/clicking the minimap canvas pans the camera target while dragging the minimap chrome/footer still moves the widget.
- Minimap colours should track live scene materials plus time/weather theme tint, not a stale fixed palette.
- Orbit still works with normal left-drag.
- Ghost boards do not become editable.
- The opacity torch is smooth and does not reveal square board seams.
- Tilt-shift overlays have `pointer-events: none` and stay below UI controls.
- Cloud shadow at 0% / low values should reduce ground shadow strength without hiding visible cloud puffs.
- Building details should be believable: manor portico columns stay entry-scale, windows have frames/crossbars, and tall buildings do not stretch entry features unrealistically.

Useful browser probes:

```js
pickTile(window.innerWidth / 2, window.innerHeight / 2)
```

```js
getComputedStyle(document.body, '::before').pointerEvents
getComputedStyle(document.body, '::after').pointerEvents
```
