# TinyWorld 25D Template Sprites

This is not the crowd system. Do not route playable template work through
`vendor/tiny-crowd-layer.js`, `crowd/`, or `engine/world/11-vehicle-crowd.js`.

Runtime:

- `engine/world/47-worlds-room.js` owns the playable in-world/player-room
  avatar from these template sheets.
- The character is runtime-only and must not write into `world[x][z]`,
  `cellMeshes`, export JSON, saved worlds, or crowd people.
- Movement uses WASD/arrows. Jump uses Space. Attack uses `F`. Class cycling
  uses `[` / `]`.
- The world-room avatar class API is exposed via `window.__tinyworldWorlds`:
  `setAvatarClass(name)`, `cycleAvatarClass(delta)`, `avatarClass()`, and
  `avatarClasses()`.
- Warrior/orc side-view avatars in `engine/world/47-worlds-room.js` are also
  64px grid sheets: columns are animation frames and rows are directions. Crop to
  a single row with `repeat.y = 1 / rows`; do not sample a full 256px-tall
  column, or four stacked bodies render in-world.
- The Worlds avatar picker/runtime should use the side-view `Without_shadow`
  sheets for swordsman/orc avatars unless the user explicitly asks for baked
  ground shadows.
- Side-view swordsman/orc row order is `front/down`, `left`, `right`, `back/up`.
  Movement should update the sampled row from the camera-relative sector; do not
  fake left/right by flipping a single side row when the sheet has real side rows.

Assets:

- Source template sheets live under `models/people/25D/`.
- Idle/walk/run sheets are 64px grid sheets.
- Attack sheets are 96px grid sheets.
- Rows are ordered: `down`, `downRight`, `right`, `upRight`, `up`, `upLeft`,
  `left`, `downLeft`.
- Generated class sheets live under `models/people/25D/classes/<class>/` as
  `idle.png`, `walk.png`, and `attack.png`.
- Regenerate class sheets with `python3 tools/generate-playable-25d-classes.py`.

When adding a class:

1. Add the class name to `CLASSES` and an overlay function in
   `tools/generate-playable-25d-classes.py`.
2. Add the class name to `AVATAR_CLASSES` in
   `engine/world/47-worlds-room.js`.
3. Regenerate sheets, then run `npm test` and `npm run build`.
